Title: 2-D Arrays(Matrix)

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: A two-dimensional array in C++ is the simplest form of a multi-dimensional array. 
It can be visualized as an array of arrays. A two-dimensional array is also called a matrix. 
It can be of any type like integer, character, float, etc. depending on the initialization.
We firstly initialize a 2D array, arr[i][j] using two for loops, one for row iteratiion and one for column iteration.
After that, we try to print the respective array ,again using two for loops.
Similarly we can add two matrix using for loops and store in a third matrix.
Algorithm:

Start => declare two matrix with specific number of rows and columns. We can lso take number of rows and columns as input from the user => take input values from user using two for loops => 
then using another two for loops add the two matrices and store in a third matrix => then use two more for loops and print the addition of the matrices i.e the third matrix => End
Explanation of the algorithm:

First we declare three matrix. Then take inputs of number of rows and columns from the user. Then we take input of the two matrices from the user,using for loop. 
Then we add the two matrix, using for loop, and store it in the third matrix. Then we print the addition of the two matrices which is stored in the third matrix, again using for loop.
